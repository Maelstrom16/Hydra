# Hydra
An emulator for a number of retro game systems, written mostly to play around with Rust.

## Files
* **src/** - *Contains all Rust code.*
    * **main.rs** - *Contains the main method. Currently only used for testing.*
    * **wgpu.rs** - *Code used for rendering content to the window.*
    * **window.rs** - *Code used for building the window itself, including menus and event handling*
* **Cargo.lock** - *Automatically generated by Cargo. Contains metadata about this project, including references to all of the libraries required for its dependencies to function.*
* **Cargo.toml** - *Contains metadata about this project, including version and dependency information.*
* **config.toml** - *Currently empty, but will be used to store emulator-specific settings (e.g. control mappings).*
* **README.md** - *This file*

## Testing
To run this application, run the following in the terminal:
```
cargo run
```
In its current state, the program will generate a window with some dummy options whose functionality is to be implemented once the GB emulator is able to support them. Clicking the `Load ROM...` button will clear the background color of the window to white, as a way to ensure wgpu is working.

I plan to support Windows, MacOS, and Linux, but I do not currently have the means to test the program on Linux. As such, it may be buggy there.
